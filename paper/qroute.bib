    abstract = {In Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, quantum processing units (QPUs) suffer from, among others, highly limited connectivity between physical qubits. To make a quantum circuit executable, a circuit transformation process is necessary to transform it into a functionally equivalent one so that the connectivity constraints imposed by the QPU are satisfied. Due to the high branching factor and vast search space, almost all existing algorithms search very shallowly and thus, very often, can reach (at most) locally optimal solutions. We propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search framework to tackle this problem, which enables the search process to go deeper. In particular, we design, by taking both short- and long-term rewards into consideration, a scoring mechanism, and propose to use a fast random strategy for simulation. The thus designed search algorithm is polynomial in all relevant parameters and empirical results on extensive realistic circuits show that it can reduce, in average, the size of the output circuits by at least 30% when compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms on IBM Q20.},

    abstract={The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses `value networks' to evaluate board positions and `policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},
